## ArchR Tutorial: Single-cell ATAC-seq Analysis  
Single-cell analysis of regulatory chromatin in R  
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00790-6  
This repository contains a walkthrough of the [official ArchR tutorial](https://www.archrproject.com/articles/Articles/tutorial.html).

## Overview

ArchR is a scalable and flexible R package for analyzing single-cell chromatin accessibility data (scATAC-seq). In this tutorial, I reproduce key steps from the official guide, including:

- Preprocessing and quality control
- Creating Arrow files and filtering cells
- Dimensionality reduction and clustering
- Gene score and peak matrix generation
- Peak calling using MACS2
- Cell-type annotation and visualization
